# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Biology (Genetics) and Statistics 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I need it to graduate and want to further my skills in scientific communication.
- I am interested in learning about how statistic can be used to communicate information gained in other scientific discplines
